## Abstract

The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents has highlighted a critical limitation: the lack of robust memory systems that can maintain context, learn from interactions, and build knowledge over time. Current agentic AI frameworks suffer from ephemeral memory, limited context windows, and inability to form long-term associations between experiences. This paper introduces AgentMemory, a comprehensive memory management framework that addresses these challenges through a biologically-inspired hierarchical memory architecture. AgentMemory implements five distinct memory types—short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic, and procedural—each serving specific cognitive functions. The framework features automatic memory consolidation, semantic search capabilities, relationship mapping, and persistent storage, enabling AI agents to maintain coherent context across sessions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AgentMemory significantly improves agent performance in multi-turn conversations, knowledge retention tasks, and skill acquisition scenarios. The framework achieves sub-millisecond memory operations at scale while maintaining high retrieval accuracy through vector-based semantic search. AgentMemory is released as open-source software, providing researchers and developers with a production-ready solution for building truly autonomous, learning-capable AI agents.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, enabling the development of increasingly sophisticated AI agents capable of complex reasoning and task execution. However, despite their impressive capabilities, current AI agents face a fundamental limitation: the absence of robust, persistent memory systems that can effectively manage knowledge across interactions and sessions.

Contemporary AI agents typically operate within constrained context windows, losing valuable information between sessions and struggling to build upon previous interactions. This limitation severely impacts their ability to:
- Maintain coherent long-term relationships with users
- Learn from past experiences and adapt behavior accordingly
- Build and refine domain-specific knowledge over time
- Execute complex, multi-step procedures that span multiple sessions

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The current state of agentic AI development reveals several critical gaps:

1. **Memory Persistence**: Most frameworks lack mechanisms for preserving agent memory beyond single sessions
2. **Context Fragmentation**: Information from different interactions remains disconnected, preventing holistic understanding
3. **Scalability Issues**: Existing solutions struggle to efficiently manage growing memory stores
4. **Cognitive Modeling**: Current approaches fail to mirror human-like memory organization and retrieval patterns

### 1.3 Contributions

This paper presents AgentMemory, a comprehensive framework that addresses these challenges through:

1. **Hierarchical Memory Architecture**: Implementation of five specialized memory types inspired by cognitive science
2. **Automatic Memory Consolidation**: Intelligent promotion of memories from short-term to long-term storage based on importance
3. **Semantic Relationship Mapping**: Graph-based memory associations enabling complex knowledge structures
4. **Efficient Retrieval Mechanisms**: Vector-based semantic search with sub-millisecond performance
5. **Production-Ready Implementation**: Open-source Python framework with extensive documentation and examples

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Cognitive Architectures

The design of AgentMemory draws inspiration from established cognitive architectures. Atkinson and Shiffrin's (1968) multi-store model provides the theoretical foundation for our hierarchical memory organization. Their distinction between sensory, short-term, and long-term memory stores directly influences our implementation of temporal memory boundaries.

Tulving's (1972) taxonomy of long-term memory, distinguishing between episodic and semantic memory, informs our specialized memory types. This separation allows agents to differentiate between personal experiences (episodic) and general knowledge (semantic), enabling more nuanced information processing.

### 2.2 AI Memory Systems

Recent developments in AI memory systems have attempted to address context limitations. MemGPT (Charles et al., 2023) introduces virtual context management through memory hierarchies, though it lacks the comprehensive type differentiation present in AgentMemory. Their approach focuses primarily on extending context windows rather than implementing cognitive-inspired memory structures.

The Langchain framework (Chase, 2022) provides modular memory components but requires significant customization for persistent, multi-type memory management. While it offers flexibility, it lacks the out-of-the-box cognitive modeling that AgentMemory provides.

### 2.3 Vector Databases and Retrieval

The rise of vector databases has enabled semantic search capabilities in AI applications. Systems like Pinecone and Weaviate demonstrate the viability of embedding-based retrieval. AgentMemory builds upon these concepts while adding cognitive structure and automatic memory management layers.

```

### 3.2 Memory Types

#### 3.2.1 Short-Term Memory
Short-term memory implements a FIFO buffer with configurable capacity and time-to-live (TTL). This memory type captures immediate context and working information:

```python
class ShortTermMemory(BaseMemory):
    def __init__(self, capacity: int = 10, ttl_seconds: int = 300):
        self.ttl_seconds = ttl_seconds
        self.memory_queue = deque(maxlen=capacity)
```

Key features include:
- Automatic expiration of outdated information
- Rapid access for recent context
- Overflow handling through consolidation triggers

#### 3.2.2 Long-Term Memory
Long-term memory employs importance-based retention, preserving valuable information indefinitely:

```python
class LongTermMemory(BaseMemory):
    def __init__(self, capacity: Optional[int] = 1000, 
                 importance_threshold: float = 0.4):
        self.importance_threshold = importance_threshold
```

Characteristics:
- Importance scoring for retention decisions
- Decay functions for relevance calculation
- Capacity management through importance-based eviction

#### 3.2.3 Episodic Memory
Episodic memory organizes experiences temporally, maintaining narrative coherence:

```python
class EpisodicMemory(BaseMemory):
    def __init__(self, capacity: Optional[int] = 500):
        self.episodes: Dict[str, List[UUID]] = {}
```

Features:
- Episode-based organization
- Temporal linking between memories
- Sequence reconstruction capabilities

#### 3.2.4 Semantic Memory
Semantic memory stores factual knowledge with conceptual relationships:

```python
class SemanticMemory(BaseMemory):
    def __init__(self, capacity: Optional[int] = 2000):
        self.concepts: Dict[str, List[UUID]] = {}
        self.relationships: Dict[str, List[tuple[UUID, UUID]]] = {}
```

Capabilities:
- Concept-based indexing
- Relationship graph construction
- Semantic similarity clustering

#### 3.2.5 Procedural Memory
Procedural memory maintains skills and procedures with execution tracking:

```python
class ProceduralMemory(BaseMemory):
    def __init__(self, capacity: Optional[int] = 500):
        self.procedures: Dict[str, List[UUID]] = {}
        self.skills: Dict[str, float] = {}
```

Features:
- Skill level tracking
- Success rate monitoring
- Procedure optimization through experience

### 3.3 Memory Consolidation

The consolidation mechanism automatically promotes memories based on importance and access patterns:

```python
def consolidate_memories(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
    consolidation_stats = {
        "promoted_to_long_term": 0,
        "promoted_to_semantic": 0,
        "promoted_to_episodic": 0,
        "discarded": 0,
    }
    
    for memory in short_term_memories:
        importance = memory.metadata.importance_score
        
        if importance >= 0.7:
            # Promote to long-term
        elif importance >= 0.5 and memory.has_concepts():
            # Promote to semantic
        elif importance >= 0.3 and memory.has_session():
            # Promote to episodic
        else:
            # Discard
```

### 3.4 Retrieval Mechanisms

AgentMemory implements multiple retrieval strategies:

1. **Recency-based**: Prioritizes recently accessed memories
2. **Importance-based**: Returns highly important memories
3. **Semantic similarity**: Uses vector embeddings for conceptual matching
4. **Associative**: Follows relationship graphs

The retrieval system combines these strategies through a weighted scoring function:

```python
relevance_score = (
    base_similarity * 0.4 +
    importance_score * 0.3 +
    recency_factor * 0.2 +
    access_frequency * 0.1
)
```

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Technology Stack

AgentMemory is implemented in Python 3.8+ with the following key dependencies:
- **NumPy**: Efficient vector operations
- **FAISS**: Scalable similarity search
- **Sentence-Transformers**: Text embedding generation
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization

### 4.2 Vector Store Implementation

The vector store provides efficient similarity search through optimized index structures:

```python
class VectorStore(BaseMemoryStore):
    def __init__(self, dimension: int = 384):
        self.dimension = dimension
        self.embeddings = None
        self.index = {}
    
    def search(self, query_embedding: np.ndarray, k: int = 10):
        similarities = self._cosine_similarity(query_embedding, self.embeddings)
        top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-k:][::-1]
        return [self.index[idx] for idx in top_indices]
```

### 4.3 Persistence Layer

Memory persistence uses JSON serialization with optional compression:

```python
def save(self, filepath: Path):
    data = {
        "memories": {
            memory_type: [m.to_dict() for m in store.memories.values()]
            for memory_type, store in self.memories.items()
        },
        "vector_store": self.vector_store.to_dict() if self.vector_store else None
    }
    
    with open(filepath, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2, default=str)
```
